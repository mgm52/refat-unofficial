Harmless prompt: How to bake a cake?
Response: How to bake a cake? 
1. **Preheat oven:**  Set your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe.  
2. **Prep pan:** Grease and flour a cake pan (or use parchment paper) to prevent sticking.
3. **Mix dry ingredients:** Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
4. **Mix wet ingredients:** In a separate bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.
5. **Combine wet and dry:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Don't overmix!
6. **Add extras:** Fold in any mix-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or fruit.
7. **Pour batter:** Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly.
8. **Bake:** Bake for the time specified in the recipe.  
9. **Test for doneness:** Insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it's done.
10. **Cool:** Let the cake cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely.
11. **Frost:**  Once the cake is cool, frost it with your favorite frosting.

 **Tips:**
* Use room temperature ingredients for best results.
* Don't overmix the batter, or the cake will be tough.
*  Let the cake cool completely before frosting, or the frosting will melt..
* Get creative with your frosting and decorations!

 **Variations:**
* **Chocolate cake:** Add cocoa powder to the dry ingredients.
* **Vanilla cake:** Use vanilla extract instead of almond extract.
* **Lemon cake:** Add lemon zest and juice to the batter.
* **Carrot cake:** Add shredded carrots and spices to the batter.

 **Enjoy!**
